# About me

📚 My name is Kai and I'm an independent student/observer of the Bitcoin ecosystem and austrian economics. Software development is my current occupation and I'm looking towards contributing to privacy and freedom enhancing tools.

🦀 In my free coding time I'm mainly doing backend stuff with Rust but Java is my most proficient language as I'm using it in my day job.

✉️ You can check out my GitHub account to see what I'm up to and contact me via Keybase or email.

🌍 Currently living in Germany.
